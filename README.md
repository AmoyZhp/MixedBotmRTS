# MixedBot

This is the bot submitted for IEEE-CoG2019 microRTS competition.

This bot integrates three agents(Tiamat[1], Capivara[2], StrategyTactics[3]) into  a single agent.

StrategyTacits proposes an idea that searching process could be divided into two parts: strategy and tactics. We use Tiamat to do strategic decision and use Capivara to do tactical decision part. Furthermore, we add an mechanism that could dynamically change the time allocated for two decision parts based on numbers of close armies.
