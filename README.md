# MixedBot

This is bot submitted for IEEE-CoG2019 microRTS competition.
This bot integrates three agent(Tiamat[1], Capivara[2], StrategyTactics[3]) into single agent.
StrategyTacits proposes a idea that searching process could de divided into two part: strategy and tacitcs. We use Tiamat to do strategic decision and use Capivara to do tacitcal decision part.Futhermore,
we add an mechanism that could dynamicly change time allocated for two decision part based on numbers of cloes armies.
